## Credit Card Interest Calculator

### Understanding Credit Card Interest

Credit card interest is calculated based on:
- **Monthly Spending**: How much you spend each month
- **Balance Carried**: Percentage of balance you carry forward
- **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**: The interest rate charged

### How to Use the Credit Card Calculator

#### Step 1: Enter Monthly Spending

```
Monthly Spending: $2,000
```

- **What it means**: Your average monthly credit card spending
- **How to calculate**: Add up all credit card purchases for the month
- **Tips**: Use bank statements or credit card apps for accuracy

#### Step 2: Set Balance Carried Percentage

```
Balance Carried: 50%
```

- **What it means**: Percentage of your monthly spending that carries over
- **How to calculate**: (Unpaid balance Ã· Monthly spending) Ã— 100
- **Example**: If you spend $2,000 but only pay $1,000, you carry 50%

#### Step 3: Enter APR

```
APR: 23%
```

- **What it means**: Annual Percentage Rate charged by your credit card
- **Where to find**: On your credit card statement or online account
- **Range**: Typically 15-30% for most credit cards

### Understanding the Results

#### Annual Interest Amount

```
Annual Interest: $2,760
```

This shows how much interest you'll pay in one year based on your inputs.

#### Monthly Savings

```
Monthly Savings: $230
```

This shows how much you could save each month by paying off your balance in full.

### Real-World Example

**Scenario**: Sarah spends $3,000/month on her credit card, carries 60% of the balance, and has a 25% APR.

**Calculation**:
- Monthly balance carried: $3,000 Ã— 60% = $1,800
- Annual interest: $1,800 Ã— 25% = $450
- Monthly savings: $450 Ã· 12 = $37.50

**Result**: Sarah pays $450/year in interest and could save $37.50/month by paying in full.

## Investment Growth Calculator

### Understanding Compound Interest

Compound interest is the interest calculated on the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods.

**Formula**: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
- A = Final amount
- P = Principal (initial investment)
- r = Annual interest rate
- n = Number of times interest is compounded per year
- t = Time in years

### How to Use the Investment Calculator

#### Step 1: Set Time Period

```
Time Period: 10 years
```

- **What it means**: How long you plan to invest
- **Range**: 1-50 years
- **Consideration**: Longer periods typically yield higher returns

#### Step 2: Enter Return Rate

```
Return Rate: 9%
```

- **What it means**: Expected annual return on your investment
- **Historical averages**:
  - S&P 500: ~10% annually
  - Conservative portfolio: 4-6%
  - Aggressive portfolio: 8-12%

#### Step 3: View the Chart

The chart shows your investment growth over time, including:
- **Principal**: Your initial investment
- **Interest**: Earned interest
- **Total**: Combined principal and interest

### Investment Strategies

#### Conservative Approach
- **Return Rate**: 4-6%
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Best for**: Short-term goals, risk-averse investors

#### Moderate Approach
