## Integration

This script is automatically called by the `release.sh` script when creating new releases. It ensures that every release has a properly formatted changelog entry with categorized changes.

## Examples

The script will automatically:
1. Analyze all commits since the last release
2. Categorize them by type and impact
3. Format them with emojis and statistics
4. Insert them into the CHANGELOG.md file
5. Maintain proper chronological order

This creates professional, readable changelogs that users and developers can easily understand.
